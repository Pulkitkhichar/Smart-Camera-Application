# Smart Camera Application

## Overview
The **Smart Camera Application** is a versatile desktop application developed using Python and OpenCV. It provides various functionalities for webcam operations, such as Photo/Video Recording, 
 Object Tracking, Motion Detection, CCTV, QR Code Scanning, and basic Photo Editing.

## Features
- **Photo/Video Recording**: Capture photos and record videos using your webcam.
- **Motion Detection**: Detect motion in real-time and record video when motion is detected.
- **Object Tracking**: Track and follow objects based on color or other visual properties.
- **QR Code Scanning**: Read and interpret QR codes directly from the webcam feed.
- **CCTV Mode**: Use the application as a simple CCTV camera system with motion detection.
- **Photo Editing**: Perform basic edits on captured photos, such as rotation, cropping, and applying filters.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for implementing the application.
- **OpenCV**: Used for image processing and video capture functionalities.
- **Tkinter**: GUI framework for creating a user-friendly interface.

## Usage
- Launch the application and select the desired mode from the interface (e.g., video recording, motion detection).
- Configure settings (if any) for the selected mode (e.g., set motion detection sensitivity).
- Start the camera and begin recording or tracking as needed.
